% This function takes a mesh and local reference frames (LRFs) for a set of
% keypoints as an input, and generate RoPS feature descriptors for the
% keypoints as an output. An illustration is shown in Fig4 in Ref.[1].
%
% Arguments : mesh - with vertices and faces           
%                       neighborSize - the size of neighborhood to define a
%                                                  local surface for a selected keypoint
%                       binSize - number of bins for 2D plane partition
%                       rotaSize - number of rotations around each coordinate axis
%                       LocalFrames - local reference frames corresponding to all
%                                                keypoints of the input mesh

% Return :         RoPS - RoPS feature descriptors corresponding to all
%                                     keypoints
